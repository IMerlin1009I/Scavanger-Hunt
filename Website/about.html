                                            <p> 
                                                We are a group of 5 friends, who after graduating from university, decided to found a small IT firm. 
                                                We have already worked on countless smaller projects, gathering tons of experience, this however is 
                                                the biggest project our company has faced yet. 
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    
                                    <div class="card bg-light text-black">
                                        <div class="card-body-about">
                                            <h1> What we want to achieve: </h1>
                                            <p>
                                                Our main goal is to make museum exhibits, public attractions, etc. more interactive especially for the younger audience. A lot of children find museums tedious and boring. We are trying to offer a solution, which makes exhibits more interactive and engaging. 
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>

                          
                                    <div class="card bg-light text-black">
                                        <div class="card-body-about">
                                            <h1> How do we want to achieve it: </h1>
                                            <p> 
                                                We want to achieve this by building an app where people can take part in scavenger hunts and explore the museum in a more interactive way. Through the wonders of modern technology we can make history come to life!
                                            </p>
                                            <h2> Example: </h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Imaging yourself visiting a museum and upon entering being offered the option to download an application which will let you experience the museum visit like never before.
                                                Let’s say there is a dinosaur exhibition being offered and to go along with the exhibition there is the option to take part in a scavenger hunt using our application for your smartphone. First you download the application and select one of the hunts available. 
                                                <br><br>
                                                After selecting one of the scavanger hunts you will receive our first clue which could be something like: 
                                                “Which animal is extinct and has two big teeth”
                                                <br><br>
                                                With the first clue on your mind you should start exploring the exhibition and keep an eye out for the animal in question. After a while you might find an animal which could fit the description and you go over and scan the QR-Code which is mounted there. When scanning the code you receive additional information about the animal as a text, image, video or a combination of those. When it turns out it was not the animal the animal the clue was referring to, you should continue looking. Then you spot a saber tooth tiger which fits the description and you scan the QR-Code and get the confirmation that this is indeed the animal the clue was referring to and you get your next clue and some additional information about the animal. 
                                                <br><br>
                                                This goes on until you have received all the clues and solved the scavenger hunt. 
                                            </p>
